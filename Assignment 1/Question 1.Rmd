# Question 1

I apply the annuity 
$R\times\sum_{n = 1}^{30} v^n=600,000$  
In which:  
$R$ is the annual payment  
$v$ is the discount factor with $v=(1+i)^{-1}$
  
```{r}
pmt=function(R) {
  i=0.035
  v=1/(1+i)
  n=c(1:30)
  a=sum(v^n)
  R*a-600000
}
```
The code create a function simulating the equation: 
$R\times\sum_{n = 1}^{30} v^n-600,000=0$  

Now we use uniroot command to find the solution for the equation.
```{r}
Q1=uniroot(pmt,interval = c(1,9999999))$root
Q1
```
The part $root extract the solution from the result table.
Testing the result:
```{r}
pmt(Q1)
```
This is the correct result.
